        "前面我们简单的介绍了强化学习的例子，从这个例子可以发现，构建强化学习的环境非常麻烦，需要耗费我们大量的时间，这个时候我们可以使用一个开源的工具，叫做 gym，是由 open ai 开发的。\n",

        "In this library, from the simple grid to the Doom, there are a variety of game environments that allow everyone to put their own AI into play. It's also very interesting to call the gym. Imagine a group of AIs exercising in the gym and honing their skills.\n",

        "If you run it, you can see that the convergence of the q table is very slow, and the reward is always difficult to change. It takes a long time for us to push the car to the end. At this time we need a more powerful weapon, then deep q network.\n"
